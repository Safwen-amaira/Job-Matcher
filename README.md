# AI-Powered Job Matching System

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an AI-powered system that automates the recruitment process by screening resumes and matching candidates to job opportunities based on their skills, qualifications, and preferences. The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze resumes, job descriptions, and provides personalized job recommendations and skill improvement suggestions. It can help HR professionals and recruiters streamline the hiring process, while also assisting job seekers in finding the most suitable roles.

### Key Features

1. **Resume Parsing & Analysis**: Extracts relevant information from resumes such as skills, experience, education, and certifications using NLP techniques.
2. **Job Matching Algorithm**: Matches candidates with the best job opportunities by analyzing their profiles and comparing them to job descriptions.
3. **Skill Gap Detection**: Identifies gaps between candidates' skills and job requirements, offering suggestions for resume improvement.
4. **Personalized Job Alerts**: Sends job recommendations based on candidate preferences, such as location, job type, and salary expectations.
5. **Automated Screening**: Automates the screening process by ranking resumes based on how well they fit job descriptions, reducing manual effort for recruiters.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- **spaCy**: Used for text parsing, tokenization, and named entity recognition to extract structured data from resumes.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A transformer-based model to understand the context of job descriptions and resumes, ensuring accurate matching.
- **GPT-3**: Used for generating personalized job recommendations and summarizing job descriptions.
  
### 2. **Machine Learning Models**

- **Scikit-learn**: Implements machine learning algorithms for matching candidates to job descriptions based on extracted features.
- **XGBoost**: Used for creating a high-performing model to rank and classify resumes according to their fit for a given role.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: These frameworks are used to build and fine-tune deep learning models, especially when processing large-scale data.

### 3. **Recommendation Systems**

- **Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Filtering**: These techniques are applied to recommend job opportunities based on user preferences and resume content.
- **K-means Clustering**: Used for grouping similar job roles and candidates to improve matching efficiency.

### 4. **Web Development**

- **Flask/Django**: Backend frameworks for building the application logic, processing data, and exposing APIs for user interactions.
- **React.js**: Frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface, allowing users to upload resumes, view job recommendations, and interact with the system.
- **Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS**: For responsive UI design, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

### 5. **Database & Cloud Infrastructure**

- **PostgreSQL/MongoDB**: Databases used to store user profiles, job listings, resumes, and other necessary data.
- **AWS S3**: For secure storage of user-uploaded resumes.
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration tools for easy deployment and scalability of the application.
- **Heroku/AWS EC2**: Platforms for deploying and hosting the application.
